# (9) â€” Currency conversion.  

# Add capability to the class Numerics to support method calls such as:

# 5.dollars.in(:euros)
# 10.euros.in(:rupees)
# You should support the currencies dollars, euros, rupees, yen where the conversions are:

# rupees to dollars, multiply by 0.019,
# yen to dollars, multiply by 0.013,
# euro to dollars, multiply by 1.292.
# Both the singular and plural forms of each currency should be acceptable, e.g. 1.dollar.in(:rupees) and10.rupees.in(:euro) should work.

# You can use the code shown below as a starting point if you wish.  You might find it helpful to reread Section 3.5 of ESaaS before working on this problem.
